        <p>ALT/SOE/023/2227 This school ID will be what the guys at altschool 
            will use to track my progress for the next couple of months, 
            and this is facinating to me every time I think of how simple 
            it sounds yet tasking for a beginner to comprehend.

            Hi, my name is Shadrach Enemona Ocheje, and SEO will do. Oh, 
            I am not the search engine optimization (SEO) you have in mind.
            Our minds as humans work wonders when we decide to use them. 
            I often set a goal and fumble it, even when I have paid good money to achieve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is why this time I want it to be different, which means I have to be different. 
          My goal for alt school is to become one of the best cloud engineers during and after 
          the program, to become a better human filled with not just technology knowledge but 
           with a better knowledge of how things work.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose to start this program because I was bored with my current business. 
            Altschool has amazing tutors who are willing to bring out the best in their students. 
            This is another avenue to upscale, position myself for the new world of technology, 
            build useful products and services, work with beautiful minds, and earn good money.
        </p>

            <h4>Who is SEO?</h4>
                <p>This is the first time I am writing a bio.</p>

            <p>Oh yes, I am currently a student at the Altschool School of Engineering, 
                trying my trade with cloud engineering. I finished my B.Sc. in 2018 at the 
                University of Lagos (Unilag), where I studied geophysics. 
                I am a dropout student at the University of Dallas (MBA program in strategic leadership). 
                I had the opportunity to attend Harvard Business School Online, where I got the prestigious 
                Disruptive Strategy Certificate in 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cooking has always been a thing for me; a few folks around me then found it strange, 
                which eventually led me to create a recipe for <a href="https://skymindagro.com/">SkymindsAgro</a> catfish fillet. 
                I am the founder and current CEO, and the company's goal is to increase the protein intake of Nigerians.

            <p>
                I guess this is enough summary for now.
